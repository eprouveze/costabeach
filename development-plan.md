## Notes for Implementation

- All user-facing text must support both French and Arabic
- Document categories must be clearly labeled and organized by date
- UI should be simple and intuitive for non-technical users
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Consider accessibility requirements throughout development 
- All UI components should have corresponding Storybook stories
- Storybook should be used for visual regression testing 

## Known Issues and Priorities

1. **Document Search**: The document browser component needs search functionality implemented
2. **Document Preview**: File preview for different formats is not yet implemented
3. **i18n Code Refactoring**: Page components need to be refactored to use shared implementations with proper i18n support
4. **Audit Logging**: Content changes should be logged for accountability
5. **User Management**: The user management interface needs to be implemented
6. **Dashboard Redesign**: The owner dashboard needs to be redesigned for document access
7. **Public Area**: The public area needs to be redesigned for the HOA portal
8. **i18n Type Errors**: Fix async function handling in i18n server utilities
