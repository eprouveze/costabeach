## Dynamic Port Handling in NextAuth (2024-03-26)

Fixed email verification links to work with dynamic ports in development. When Next.js assigns different ports (e.g., when 3000 is busy), the auth system now:

1. Uses `headers()` to detect the current port dynamically
2. Updates verification email links with correct port
3. Handles redirects properly after verification
4. Works seamlessly when Next.js changes ports (3000 → 3001 → 3002)

3. Enhanced owner dashboard access control to properly check for verified owner status
4. Added fallback user object creation with appropriate permissions for testing
5. Fixed the issue where users couldn't access the owner dashboard due to RLS policy violations

These changes ensure that:
- Users are automatically redirected to fix database permissions when needed
- The application gracefully handles database setup issues
- Only verified owners can access the owner dashboard
- The user experience is improved with helpful error messages and automatic remediation

## Improved User Experience for Database Setup (2025-03-03)

Improved the user experience when encountering database setup issues:

1. Removed automatic redirection to the database setup API endpoint, which was confusing for regular users
2. Added more user-friendly error messages that instruct users to contact the administrator
3. Added detailed logging for administrators to help diagnose and fix database issues
4. Maintained fallback user object creation to ensure the application can still function with database issues

These changes ensure that:
- Regular users receive clear, non-technical error messages
- Administrators can still access the necessary information to fix database issues
- The application gracefully handles database setup problems without disrupting the user experience
- The system maintains security while providing better error recovery

## Fixed build errors in user creation by adding required UUID id field to all user creation operations.

## Standardized email address to info@costabeach.ma across the entire codebase (2025-03-03)

Replaced various email addresses (costabeach.com, costabeach3.com) with the official info@costabeach.ma email in:

1. Email sender address in the owner registrations API
2. Contact information in all locale files (en, fr, ar)
3. Footer component contact information
4. Contact form stories and documentation
5. User creation in sample documents upload script

This ensures consistency across all user-facing content and backend communications.

## Fixed Database Schema Mismatch and Auth Integration Issues (2024-07-03)

Fixed issues with database schema mismatch and auth integration:

1. Updated Prisma schema to remove legacy auth fields:
   - Removed `hashedPassword` field from User model (now handled by Supabase Auth)
   - Temporarily commented out self-referential Document relationship until database is synced

2. Fixed documents utility to handle missing database columns:
   - Updated documents query to remove reference to missing translatedDocument relation
   - Added fallback values to satisfy TypeScript types without requiring database changes

3. Generated updated Prisma client reflecting these changes

These changes ensure compatibility between the codebase and actual database structure, allowing the application to run without errors even when some schema updates haven't been fully applied to the database yet.

## Enhanced Database Schema Handling in Documents Utility (2024-07-03)

Implemented a more robust solution for the missing database column issue:

1. Added try-catch pattern in `getDocumentsByCategory` function to gracefully handle Prisma errors
2. Implemented fallback to raw SQL query when encountering the `translated_document_id` column error
3. Enhanced the SQL fallback to properly support search, filtering, pagination, and ordering
4. Added proper type mapping to ensure the returned data matches the Document interface

This resilient approach ensures the application works correctly even with database schema mismatches, providing several benefits:
- Prevents errors when the database schema doesn't exactly match the Prisma schema
- Allows gradual schema updates without breaking existing functionality
- Provides detailed logging to help identify and diagnose schema issues
- Maintains consistent type safety throughout the application

## Fixed SQL syntax error in getDocumentsByCategory by properly implementing parameterized queries with $queryRawUnsafe.

## Fixed SQL syntax error in getDocumentsByCategory function (2025-03-03)

Fixed error in the documents utility that was preventing the owner dashboard from loading documents:

1. Identified an issue where the fallback SQL query was referring to an `is_translated` column that doesn't exist in the database
2. Updated the query to remove the missing column from the SELECT statement
3. Added a default value (`false`) for `isTranslated` in the result mapping
4. Improved parameter handling to ensure correct numbering regardless of which conditions are applied
5. Enhanced error handling for database schema mismatches

This change makes the document listing resilient to database schema differences while maintaining proper type safety throughout the application.

## Fixed DocumentPreview story by removing extra properties from author objects that were causing type errors
- Updated upload-sample-documents.ts script to use correct field names (isPublished, view_count, download_count) that match the Prisma schema
