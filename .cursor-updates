# Cursor Updates

## Dynamic Port Handling in NextAuth (2024-03-26)

Fixed email verification links to work with dynamic ports in development. When Next.js assigns different ports (e.g., when 3000 is busy), the auth system now:

1. Uses `headers()` to detect the current port dynamically
2. Updates verification email links with correct port
3. Handles redirects properly after verification
4. Works seamlessly when Next.js changes ports (3000 → 3001 → 3002)

Key files modified:
- `src/lib/auth/index.ts`: Updated NextAuth config to handle dynamic ports
- Email verification now works correctly regardless of assigned port

Note: In production, this change is transparent as the port is handled by the hosting platform.
