# Session Status - June 15, 2025

## Overview
This session continued work from a previous conversation where internationalization had been completed and authentication issues resolved. The user made several explicit requests to improve the Costa Beach owner portal.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Navigation and Layout Fixes
- **Removed polls link from top navigation menu** - Fixed redundancy with sidebar navigation
- **Fixed polls page layout** - Now uses OwnerDashboardTemplate like other dashboard pages
- **Applied proper internationalization** - Fixed English text in polls page titles, descriptions, status filters, and search placeholders

### 2. Document Display System Improvements
- **Fixed "Tous les documents" empty results** - Now properly displays ALL documents across categories
- **Implemented view mode toggle** - Added tiles/list/table view options with persistent user preferences via localStorage
- **Enhanced document cards** - Improved layout and styling for all three view modes
- **Fixed document name column width** - Made document titles more prominent in table view

### 3. Missing Pages Created
- **Profile page** (`/owner-dashboard/profile`) - Complete profile management with language preferences
- **Settings page** (`/owner-dashboard/settings`) - User settings including language and notification preferences
- **Added proper translations** - All profile and settings pages now fully internationalized

### 4. Permission System Enhancements
- **Restricted poll creation** - Only admins and Comit√© de Suivi members can create polls
- **Permission-based UI** - Poll creation buttons only shown to authorized users

### 5. Document Translation System
- **Automated translation workflow** - Translation is now automated, removing manual "Traduire" buttons
- **Document grouping** - Documents with translations now display as single line items with language flags
- **Performance optimization** - Moved translation grouping from client-side to API level for better performance
- **API improvements** - Updated `getAllDocuments` to only fetch original documents and include their translations with proper enum casting

### 6. User Interface Improvements
- **Modal-based document preview** - Converted from new tabs to modal overlays
- **Preview capability detection** - Only shows "Aper√ßu" buttons for previewable file types
- **Fixed toggle UI styling** - Resolved dark mode display issues
- **Improved modal design** - Updated DocumentPreview modal to match admin upload modal style with better backdrop, animations, and button styling

### 7. Translation Request Removal
- **Disabled translation buttons** - Removed "Request Translation" functionality from both DocumentPreview.tsx and organisms/DocumentPreview.tsx
- **Updated translation logic** - Modified `shouldShowTranslationButton()` to always return false since translation is automated

### 8. TypeScript and Build Fixes
- **Fixed SettingsContent TypeScript error** - Added proper type casting for Locale type (`e.target.value as "fr" | "en" | "ar"`)
- **Cleaned build cache** - Resolved webpack module resolution issues with `rm -rf .next`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT BUILD STATUS
The build is currently **FAILING** due to URL configuration issues in admin/whatsapp and auth/signout routes. This appears to be an environment/configuration issue unrelated to our code changes:

```
Error: Invalid URL
    at new URL (node:internal/url:819:25)
    at t.default (/Users/emmanuel/Documents/Dev/costabeach/.next/server/chunks/5565.js:1:35960)
```

However, the TypeScript compilation passes, indicating our code changes are syntactically correct.

## üîÑ PENDING TASKS

### 1. Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fix "Pv Ag costa beach 2 GH4" document** - Currently showing only 2 flags instead of all 3 available language versions
- **Fix dark title text** - Document titles appearing as dark text on dark background in some views
- **Complete modal styling** - Ensure DocumentPreview modal fully matches admin upload modal aesthetic

### 2. Performance Issues
- **Address slow document loading** - Document list pages are very slow to load (partially addressed by API-level grouping)
- **Optimize translation queries** - Further optimize the getAllDocuments API for better performance

### 3. Language Flag Display
- **Debug availableLanguages array** - Investigate why some documents don't show all available language flags
- **Verify translation relationships** - Ensure database relationships are correctly established for all translated documents

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

### Core Components
- `src/components/organisms/Header.tsx` - Removed polls navigation link
- `src/components/DashboardContent.tsx` - Added view modes, removed client-side grouping
- `src/components/DocumentCard.tsx` - Enhanced with table/list/tiles view modes
- `src/components/DocumentPreview.tsx` - Disabled translation requests
- `src/components/organisms/DocumentPreview.tsx` - Updated modal styling, removed translation functionality
- `src/components/SettingsContent.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript type error

### API Layer
- `src/lib/api/routers/documents.ts` - Updated getAllDocuments for translation grouping and performance
- `src/lib/types.ts` - Added availableLanguages property to Document interface

### New Pages
- `app/[locale]/owner-dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - Complete profile management
- `app/[locale]/owner-dashboard/settings/page.tsx` - User settings management
- `src/components/ProfileContent.tsx` - Profile page content component
- `src/components/SettingsContent.tsx` - Settings page content component

### Internationalization
- `src/lib/i18n/locales/fr.json` - Added profile and settings translations
- `src/lib/i18n/locales/en.json` - Added profile and settings translations  
- `src/lib/i18n/locales/ar.json` - Added profile and settings translations

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

1. **Resolve build issues** - Fix URL configuration problems preventing successful builds
2. **Debug language flags** - Investigate why "Pv Ag costa beach 2 GH4" shows 2/3 flags
3. **Complete visual fixes** - Address remaining dark text on dark background issues
4. **Performance optimization** - Further improve document loading speeds
5. **Testing** - Ensure all functionality works correctly after fixes

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### Database Schema
- All Prisma models use consistent camelCase properties with @map() directives
- Translation relationships properly established through `other_documents` relation
- `isTranslation` field distinguishes original documents from translations

### API Design
- `getAllDocuments` fetches only original documents (`isTranslation: false`)
- Includes translations via `other_documents` relationship
- Properly formats `availableLanguages` array with all language versions
- Uses proper enum casting for DocumentCategory and Language types

### UI Architecture
- View mode preferences stored in localStorage
- Modal-based document preview with consistent styling
- Permission-based UI rendering for admin features
- Responsive design across all view modes

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES

1. **Build failing** - Production builds currently not working due to URL configuration
2. **Missing language flags** - Some documents not showing all available translations
3. **Performance** - Document pages still loading slowly despite optimizations

The session work successfully implemented most requested features but left some critical issues that need immediate attention before deployment.
