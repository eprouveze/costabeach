# Comprehensive Fix for Prisma Naming Inconsistency - Implementation Plan

## Problem Analysis
The codebase has **inconsistent Prisma schema naming patterns** that cause recurring TypeScript errors:

1. **NextAuth models** (User, Account): camelCase with @map() directives  
2. **Custom models** (documents, polls, etc.): snake_case without @map()
3. **17+ files** affected across services, APIs, and tests
4. **No enforcement mechanism** to prevent future inconsistencies

## Solution: Standardize to Industry Best Practices

### Phase 1: Schema Standardization (No Database Impact) ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Update documents model to use camelCase fields with @map() directives
- ✅ Update polls model to use camelCase fields with @map() directives  
- ✅ Update poll_options model to use camelCase fields with @map() directives
- ✅ Update audit_log model to use camelCase fields with @map() directives
- ✅ Update votes model to use camelCase fields with @map() directives
- ✅ Generate Prisma client with new schema

### Phase 2: Codebase Migration ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Update all TypeScript code to use camelCase field names
- ✅ Fix 17+ affected files: services, API routes, utilities, tests
- ✅ Update type definitions and interfaces
- ✅ Ensure all Prisma operations use camelCase
- ✅ Fix TypeScript compilation errors in pollsService.ts and pollTranslationService.ts
- ✅ Fix translationService.ts relation issues
- ✅ Update AI client method calls in whatsappAssistant.ts

### Phase 3: Enhanced Rules & Enforcement ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md with crystal-clear naming rules
- ✅ Add TypeScript types that enforce correct field names
- ✅ Create utility functions for common operations
- ✅ Add pre-commit hooks or build-time checks

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Run validation script to detect violations
- ✅ Fix identified naming inconsistencies  
- ✅ Test all new npm scripts and utilities
- ✅ Verify build-time validation works correctly
- ✅ Test TypeScript utility functions

## Key Files to Update in Phase 2

Based on grep analysis, these files need updates:
- `/src/lib/services/pollsService.ts`
- `/src/lib/api/routers/documents.ts`
- `/src/app/api/polls/route.ts`
- `/src/lib/utils/documents.ts`
- `/app/api/documents/[id]/preview/route.ts`
- `/app/api/documents/[id]/download/route.ts`
- `/scripts/upload-sample-documents.ts`
- `/src/app/api/documents/[id]/download/route.ts`
- `/src/lib/utils/translations.ts`
- `/src/app/api/polls/[id]/route.ts`
- Various test files

## Field Name Mappings

### documents model:
- `file_path` → `filePath`
- `file_type` → `fileType` 
- `file_size` → `fileSize`
- `is_public` → `isPublic`
- `view_count` → `viewCount`
- `download_count` → `downloadCount`
- `created_at` → `createdAt`
- `updated_at` → `updatedAt`
- `created_by` → `createdBy`
- `original_document_id` → `originalDocumentId`
- `is_translation` → `isTranslation`
- `searchable_text` → `searchableText`

### polls model:
- `poll_type` → `pollType`
- `is_anonymous` → `isAnonymous`
- `allow_comments` → `allowComments`
- `start_date` → `startDate`
- `end_date` → `endDate`
- `created_by` → `createdBy`
- `created_at` → `createdAt`
- `updated_at` → `updatedAt`

### poll_options model:
- `poll_id` → `pollId`
- `option_text` → `optionText`
- `order_index` → `orderIndex`
- `created_at` → `createdAt`

### audit_log model:
- `user_id` → `userId`
- `entity_type` → `entityType`
- `entity_id` → `entityId`
- `created_at` → `createdAt`

## Benefits
- **Eliminates recurring TypeScript errors**
- **Consistent camelCase across entire codebase**  
- **Industry-standard Prisma pattern**
- **Clean separation: camelCase app, snake_case database**
- **Future-proof with clear enforcement rules**

## Risk Mitigation
- Schema changes use @map() so **zero database impact**
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Gradual rollout if needed
- Rollback plan via git history

## Completed Work Summary

### ✅ Phase 1: Schema Standardization 
- Updated documents, polls, poll_options, audit_log, votes models
- Added @map() directives for all snake_case database fields
- Added missing relations between polls ↔ options ↔ votes
- Generated Prisma client with consistent camelCase interface

### ✅ Phase 2: Codebase Migration (COMPLETED)
