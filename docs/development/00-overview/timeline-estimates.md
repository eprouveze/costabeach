- **Risk**: API approval delays, webhook complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start approval process early, fallback to basic messaging
- **Buffer**: Additional week if needed

**Q&A Assistant Performance (Week 10)**
- **Risk**: Response time requirements, context quality
- **Mitigation**: Caching strategies, prompt optimization
- **Buffer**: Simplified version if needed

### Medium Risk (Could add 2-3 days)
**Database Migration Complexity (Week 1)**
- **Risk**: RLS policy conflicts, data integrity
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing, rollback procedures

**AI Testing Reliability (Week 1)**
- **Risk**: Non-deterministic outputs, mock complexity
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test patterns, fallback strategies

### Low Risk (Minimal impact)
**PDF Viewer Browser Compatibility**
- **Risk**: Older browser support
- **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, fallback options

**Search Performance**
- **Risk**: Large document collections
- **Mitigation**: Indexing strategies, pagination

## üìà Velocity Tracking

### Expected Velocity
```
Story Points per Week: 10-12 (sustainable pace)
Team Size: 1-2 developers
Working Days: 5 days per week
Story Points per Day: 2-2.5 average
